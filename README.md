## Why I created this app
I created this app to learn frontend skills like Typescript, Next.js and TailwindCSS.

There are NO experiences to write frontend code until creating this app.
From experiences and learnings from this app, today I have worked fullstack engineer at SaaS startup company in Japan.


## Inspired Design
This webapp is inspired by Notion.
