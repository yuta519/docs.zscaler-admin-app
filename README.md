## Why I created this app
I created this app to learn frontend skills like Typescript, Next.js and TailwindCSS.

There are NO experiences to write frontend code until creating this app.
From experiences and learnings from this app, today I have worked fullstack engineer at SaaS startup company in Japan.

And this site shows my profiles, so if you are a recruiter, please check this.

## What I struggled
- Using new stacks
  - This repository uses Next.js and TailwindCSS. But I have no experiences about these skills in my career.
  - So Why does this adopt new technologies? This is because Next.js and TailwindCSS are leading libraries and frameworks. These will be standard to create Web app in next 3 years.
  - I started to read documents hard and finally created this project.

- Creating a whole frontend application
  - I had never experienced to develop a frontend app from scratch. I have modified existing features and add new ones in team projects.
  - So I had no ideas how to create and deploy my app at first .
  - From many readings, finally I decided to choose github pages.  Because it looks easy to deploy and I often use github.
  - Soon, I plant to move this project from github pages to  vercel. After migration, I will post a blog!

- Career Modal
  - By clicking career blocks, page shows a career modal.
  - It was difficult to create modal by using tailwind css.
  - Also managing states were difficult.
