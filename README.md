## Why I created this app
I created this app to learn frontend skills like Typescript, Next.js and TailwindCSS.

There are NO experiences to write frontend code until creating this app.
From experiences and learnings from this app, today I have worked fullstack engineer at SaaS startup company in Japan.

## What I struggled
- Creating a whole frontend application
  - I had never experienced to develop a frontend app from scratch. Just modifiied some problems.
  - So at first I had no ideas how to deploy my app.
  - Finally I decided to choose github pages because it is easy to deploy and I often use github so no warries.
  - In the near future, it is plan to move vercel from github pages.
